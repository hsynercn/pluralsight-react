-React is a library

Why React
-A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-We describe user interface with react
-React is declarative
-But isn't the HTML already declarative
    *HTML:Declarative for static content
    *React:Declarative for dynamic data
-How exactly is NOT being a framework a good thing?
    *Good for small teams and startups, some design decisions are already made
    *Limited Flexibility
        -Do things a certain way
        -Hard to deviate
    *Large and full of features
        -Hard to customize
        -Use the whole thing

Pure Unix philosophy:

Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text steams,
because that is a universal interface.

React:A "language" to model the state of UIs, not the
transaction of them.

Benefits of React:
-The "virtual" browser (vs. DOM API)
-"Just JavaScript"
-React Native (for the win)
-Battle-tested
-Declarative language (model UI and state)
